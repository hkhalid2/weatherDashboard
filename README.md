# weatherDashboard

The main purpose of this project was to create a weather app using the weather API and utilize the get/fetch call to recieve and display various weather data/the future 5-day forecast. 

The user enters the city's name they would like to see the weather/forecast of and it is saved to localstorage and in a visible search history sidebar. If the user click on any city in the sidebar, the app then redierects to show that city's weather and forecast. A clear button is also added to clear the search history as well as localstorage.
